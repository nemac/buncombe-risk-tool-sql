--The creation of the exposure levels and adaptive capacity data table
--This process includes creating the tables intersecting of parcels and features within the 100 and 500 year floodplain
--When the intersection is being ran it pulls out the pinnum geometry building class and building values
--Once the exposued features have been found then a field is added to show whether or not the building within the parcel is also exposed--
--Year built values are then joined to the parcels data gatherinh all the metrics needed to assess vulbnerability-----
